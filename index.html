        <span class="introHeader">What is this website?</span><br>
        <span class="normalIntro">In short, this website serves as my personal website, a website which I hope to put my 
          coding projects, experiments and other sources I like. In addition, I hope that I will frequently be able to update this website and 
          expand it along the years.<br>I started this website in 2016, in hopes to making my own personal website a reality; a 
          website that I could document my projects as well as improve my coding skills.<br>I created this website with 
          <a href="https://www.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and I found that it was extremely engaging to use. I recommend that 
          you use this fantastic service if you're looking to create a website. In addition, I used 
          <a href="https://codeanywhere.com" target="_blank">Code Anywhere</a> to write my code. It's also a great tool for creating your 
          personal website. Finally, you can also access my website by typing in <b>v.ht/anitu</b> instead of the entire URL.

        <span class="normalIntro">
          There are many fun things you'll find on this website... On the projects page, you'll see a list of the projects that I did, such as games like the <i>Snake Game</i>
          or the classic rock paper scissors. In addition, I'll also list coding experiments that I'm working on right now. (Such as an experiment named <b><i>Cloudr</i></b>, an application similar to <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>)
          <br>What's more, you can learn a little more about me (on the "About me" page) as well as see other links on the "Other pages" page.

        <span class="normalIntro">
          You may be wondering, does this website have a blog? Well, technically, no, but also yes...<br>This is because it's really hard to create my own blog, and allow people to comment. So, to solve the problem, I created a blog page using <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> that you can visit at <a href="https://albertnitu.wordpress.com/">albertnitu.wordpress.com</a>.<br>There, you can comment on anything related to my website and explore my posts.<b> ENJOY!</b>

              <li id="codingLanguagesLi"><b>Don't be obnoxious:</b> Being obnoxious, ignorant and loud is not awesome. Try to not make big reactions to things, it makes everyone feel awkward, and creates a bad impression.</li>
              <li id="codingLanguagesLi"><b>Earn money:</b> Having your parents buy everything for you is not cool. Besides, if you earn your own money, you'll learn how to manage your own money earlier on.</li>
              <li id="codingLanguagesLi"><b>Speak properly and have good grammar:</b> Try not to use slang words and use shortcuts on chats. Seriously, it's as if you never went to school!</li>
              <li id="codingLanguagesLi"><b>Use big words:</b> Expand your brain thesaurus, it won't only make you stand out and look smart, but it will help you later in life.</li>
              <li id="codingLanguagesLi"><b>Don't follow the crowd:</b> Don't be a follower, follow your ideas and make up your own trends. It will make you stand out from the crowd.</li>
              <li id="codingLanguagesLi"><b>Don't brag and smother people with your own interests:</b> The world isn't only about you, and the more you keep bragging and talking about your interest, the more annoying you will become.</li>

              <li id="codingLanguagesLi"><b>Play board and mind games instead of video games:</b> Although video games <i>might</i> improve hand eye coordination, board games will do much more; they'll increase your intelligence.</li>

              <li id="codingLanguagesLi"><b>Explain stuff to others:</b> "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough," Albert Einstein said. By explaining topics to other people, you strengthen your memory on that topic.</li>

        <span class="normalIntro">My name is Albert Nitu, a 13 year old boy in grade 8. Since you probably don't know me, let me introduce myself:<br>I am very fascinated about 
          the world and how everything goes together. In short, I'm interested in anything related to Science and Math and I enjoy learning as much about them as possible. Naturally, that 
          means that my favorite subjects in school are Science and Math.<br>But those aren't the only things that I like: I also enjoy music and I play the ukulele, piano, clarinet, and the trombone. 
          (Sort of...) In addition, my favorite genre of music is classical music, and one of my favorite pieces of music (I don't have <i>one</i> favorite music piece) is 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tr0otuiQuU" target="_blank">Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven</a>. Lastly, I play grade 8 piano, although I've played songs meant to be for ARCT.

      <br><br>
      <div class="intro"><span class="introHeader">My hobbies and passions</span><br>
        <span class="normalIntro">Along my years, I've had many passions, each coming and going. For example, when I was six, I was really interested in Dinosaurs, and I memorized the name and look 
          of any dinosaur I read about. (I still remember them to date...)<br>My last passion, which is still "co-existing" with my current passion, was Anatomy & Biology. I started getting interested in anatomy 
          when I went to a dissection course. (When I was 8 years old) Since then, my passion for anatomy steadily grew, and I started drawing (which is another of my current hobbies) sketches of the insides of animals. (To study their physiology)
          Then, when I was 9 years old, I decided to write a book about the human body, and I kept on working on it whenever I had time. Finlly, 3 years later, I had completed my book, (which had grown to be 300 pages long) 
          and I published it. (When I was 12 years old) Since then, I have earned so much more about the human body, and I've memorized every single major cardiovascular vessel, every major nerve, all muscles (with the exception of a few...), 
          and every part of the Brain and their functions.<br> As of now, I'm (apart from anatomy) interested in coding, and I've created many coding projects (including this website) that I hope to share with you... (Such as an articificial intelligence robot with VBScript)

      <div class="intro"><span class="introHeader">Coding languages in know:</span><br>
        <span class="normalIntro">I find that coding is really fun to do, and that it will help later in life. If you haven't started coding, I strongly suggest you do, as it's <b>extremely</b> fun to do. You can start 
          to learn how to code at w3schools, a website that teaches you a ton of programming languages step by step. (And it's really easy to follow, so you'll learn how to code in no time!)<br>Anyhow, I started coding when I was 7 years old, and here 
          are some coding languages that I know:
          <ul id="codingLanguages">
            <li id="codingLanguagesLi">HTML (How could this website have been created without it?)</li>
            <li id="codingLanguagesLi">CSS (Is there really any other way to style a website without CSS?)</li>
            <li id="codingLanguagesLi">JavaScript (How else could this website react to what you do?)</li>
            <li id="codingLanguagesLi">JQuery (A JavaScript library that makes JavaScript <b>much</b> simpler)</li>
            <li id="codingLanguagesLi">PHP (The language used to "write" to databases)</li>
            <li id="codingLanguagesLi">SQL (Another language used for server side operations!)</li>
            <li id="codingLanguagesLi">Python (One, if not <b>the</b> most powerful programming language)</li>
            <li id="codingLanguagesLi">C/C++ (A language used for almost anything, including robots!)</li>
            <li id="codingLanguagesLi">Java (I don't think I can get any worse at it though...)</li>
            <li id="codingLanguagesLi">VBScript (A server side language created by Microsoft)</li>
            <li id="codingLanguagesLi">Batch (Although I suck at it)</li>
