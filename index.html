        challenges, and more!<br>It's also a chance to play games and other creations that I coded with

      <span class="introHeader">What is this website?</span><br>
      <span class="normalIntro">In short, this website serves as my personal website, a website which I hope to put my 
        coding projects, experiments and other sources I like. In addition, I hope that I will frequently be able to update this website and 
        expand it along the years.<br>I started this website in 2016, in hopes to making my own personal website a reality; a 
        website that I could document my projects as well as improve my coding skills.<br>I created this website with 
        <a href="https://www.000webhost.com/">000webhost</a> and I found that it was extremely easy to use. I recommend that 
        you use this fantastic service if you're looking to create a website. In addition, I used 
        <a href="https://codeanywhere.com">Code Anywhere</a> to write my code. It's also a great tool for creating your 
        personal website. Finally, you can also access my website by typing in <b>v.ht/science</b> instead of the entire URL.

      <span class="normalIntro">
        There are many fun things you'll find on this website... On the projects page, you'll see a list of the projects that I did, such as games like the <i>Snake Game</i>
        or the classic rock paper scissors) In addition, I'll also list of coding experiments that I'm working on right now. (Such as an experiment named <b><i>Cloudr</i></b>, an application similar to <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a>)
        <br>What's more, you can learn a little more about me (on the "About me" page) as well as see other links on the "Other pages" page.

      <span class="normalIntro">My name is Albert Nitu, a 13 year old boy in grade 8. Since you probably don't know me, let me introduce myself:<br>I am very fascinated about 
        the world and how everything goes together. In short, I'm interested in anything related to Science and Math and I enjoy learning as much about them as possible. Naturally, that 
        means that my favorite subjects in school are Science and Math.<br>But those aren't the only things that I like: I also enjoy music and I play the ukulele, piano, clarinet, and the trombone. 
        (Sort of...) In addition, my favorite genre of music is classical music, and one of my favorite pieces of music (I don't have <i>one</i> favorite music piece) is 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Tr0otuiQuU">Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven</a>. Lastly, I play grade 8 piano, although I've played songs meant to be for ARCT.

    <div class="intro"><span class="introHeader">My hobbies and passions</span><br>
      <span class="normalIntro">Along my years, I've had many passions, each coming and going. For example, when I was six, I was really interested in Dinosaurs, and I memorized the name and look 
        of any dinosaur I read about. (I still remember them to date...)<br>My last passion, which is still "co-existing" with my current passion, was Anatomy & Biology. I started getting interested in anatomy 
        when I went to a dissection course. (When I was 8 years old) Since then, my passion for anatomy steadily grew, and I started drawing (which is another of my current hobbies) sketches of the insides of animals. (To study their physiology)
        Then, when I was 9 years old, I decided to write a book about the human body, and I kept on working on it whenever I had time. Finlly, 3 years later, I had completed my book, (which had grown to be 300 pages long) 
        and I published it. (When I was 12 years old) Since then, I have earned so much more about the human body, and I've memorized every single major cardiovascular vessel, every major nerve, all muscles (with the exception of a few...), 
        and every part of the Brain and their functions.<br> As of now, I'm (apart from anatomy) interested in coding, and I've created many coding projects (including this website) that I hope to share with you... (Such as an articificial intelligence robot with VBScript)

    <div class="intro"><span class="introHeader">Coding languages in know:</span><br>
      <span class="normalIntro">I find that coding is really fun to do, and that it will help later in life. If you haven't started coding, I strongly suggest you do, as it's <b>extremely</b> fun to do. You can start 
        to learn how to code at w3schools, a website that teaches you a ton of programming languages step by step. (And it's really easy to follow, so you'll learn how to code in no time!)<br>Anyhow, I started coding when I was 7 years old, and here 
        are some coding languages that I know:
        <ul id="codingLanguages">
          <li id="codingLanguagesLi">HTML (How could this website have been created without it?)</li>
          <li id="codingLanguagesLi">CSS (Is there really any other way to style a website without CSS?)</li>
          <li id="codingLanguagesLi">JavaScript (How else could this website react to what you do?)</li>
          <li id="codingLanguagesLi">JQuery (A JavaScript library that makes JavaScript <b>much</b> simpler)</li>
          <li id="codingLanguagesLi">PHP (The language used to "write" to databases)</li>
          <li id="codingLanguagesLi">SQL (Another language used for server side operations!)</li>
          <li id="codingLanguagesLi">Python (One, if not <b>the</b> most powerful programming language)</li>
          <li id="codingLanguagesLi">C/C++ (A language used for almost anything, including robots!)</li>
          <li id="codingLanguagesLi">Java (I don't think I can get any worse at it though...)</li>
          <li id="codingLanguagesLi">VBScript (A server side language created by Microsoft)</li>
          <li id="codingLanguagesLi">Batch (Although I suck at it)</li>
        </ul>
