    <span class="normalIntro">Here, you can explore more about me, my hobbies, my projects and coding
      challenges, and more!<br>It's also a chance to play games and other creations that I coded with
      <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">Javascript</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp">Jquery</a>, 
      <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/php/">PHP</a>, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp">SQL</a>, and some 
      <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/">Python</a>.<br>All in all, I hope that you have fun on this website and that you learn a little more 
      (hopefully not <i>too much</i>) about me.<br><span class="introHeader">Enjoy!</span>

    <span class="introHeader">What is this website?</span><br>
    <span class="normalIntro">In short, this website serves as my personal website, a website which I hope to put my 
      coding projects, experiments and other sources I like. In addition, I hope that I will frequently be able to update this website and 
      expand it along the years.<br>I started this website in 2016, in hopes to making my own personal website a reality; a 
      website that I could document my projects as well as improve my coding skills.<br>I created this website with 
      <a href="https://www.000webhost.com/">000webhost</a> and I found that it was extremely easy to use. I recommend that 
      you use this fantastic service if you're looking to create a website. In addition, I used 
      <a href="https://codeanywhere.com">Code Anywhere</a> to write my code. It's also a great tool for creating your 
      personal website. Finally, you can also access my website by typing in <b>v.ht/science</b> instead of the entire URL.

    <span class="introHeader">A quick look at what's inside...</span><br>
    <span class="normalIntro">
      There are many fun things you'll find on this website... On the projects page, you'll see a list of the projects that I did, such as games like the <i>Snake Game</i>
      or the classic rock paper scissors) In addition, I'll also list of coding experiments that I'm working on right now. (Such as an experiment named <b><i>Cloudr</i></b>, an application similar to <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a>)
      <br>What's more, you can learn a little more about me (on the "About me" page) as well as see other links on the "Other pages" page.
