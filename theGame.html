      <span class="normalIntro">The Game is a mental game where the objective is to avoid thinking about The Game itself.
        Thinking about The Game constitutes a loss, which must be announced each time it occurs. It is impossible to win The Game, and once someone has lost,
        they must try to make as many other people lose it as well.<br>
        What is more, the origins of The Game are unknown...
