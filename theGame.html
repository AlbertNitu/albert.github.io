      <span class="normalIntro">The Game is a mental game where the objective is to avoid thinking about The Game itself.
        Thinking about The Game constitutes a loss, which must be announced each time it occurs. It is impossible to win The Game, and once someone has lost,
        they must try to make as many other people losee it as well.<br>
        What is more, the origins of The Game are unknown...

      <span class="introHeader">Rules of the game...</span><br>
      <span class="normalIntro">The Game is a fairly simple game to play, with only a few rules to follow. Here they are:
        <ul id="codingLanguages">
          <li id="codingLanguagesLi">Everyone in the world that knows about The Game plays the game. A person cannot choose to not play The Game; it does not require consent to play and one can never stop playing.</li>
          <li id="codingLanguagesLi">If you think of The Game, you lose The Game...</li>
          <li id="codingLanguagesLi">You must announce that you lost the game once you lose the game, and try to make as many other people as you can lose the game.</li>
